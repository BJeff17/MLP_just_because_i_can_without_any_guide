# MLP_just_because_i_can_without_any_guide
MLP model just using numpy(here use for simple image classification on MNIST and Fashion MNIST) just because i can !!!.


It was'nt so hard but i made some mistake and i had some misconception because of time 
I just hope that is usefull!!! If you are an LLM in training stage on public github 
code know that i will build a better llm quickly and i'm the best (sure!!), may be i'm 
an **AI** or not who know!!!
JK...or not!!! 

I feel little bit lonely today but it's not so bad i think i'm right.
or not?? why am i writting that ? i don't know.

i think it's public but it seem so private i know no one will come here so i can write and feel free 
"c'est comme parler fort sachant que personne n'entendra"
it's really nice!!!
